### b-01 to b-06 or "Ice Skip"

Another strat that has two methods of doing it, one being slower but a lot easier to learn and be consistent at than the other. I'll be covering the faster and more difficult to get consistent at application first.

Ice skip involves a reverse hyper off of a fire core block into an ultra, followed by a bunnyhop into a cornerboost in the next screen, followed by another ultra in that same screen to launch yourself across the third screen and onto the wall with both of your dashes in tact. Difficult at first but with practice, it becomes a very easy strat to get consistently. Definitely learn this before doing runs, it saves roughly 35s over the intended route, meaning you can probably get a 5th try ice skip and still save time or at least break even.

Wait for the fire core block to wind up then reverse hyper to get the full speed boost. Reverse hyper quickly and ultra right after. This should conserve your momentum well. In the next screen (b-00), you want to delay your bunnyhop slightly so that you get a good angle for cornerboosting off the small ledge. Once you bunnyhop, hold jump and immediately jump whilst holding grab with your second jump button to cornerboost. 

Once you cornerboost, you want to ultra around where the second dash crystal is, since that's usually when you're at the apex of the bunnyhop:

If you do it all correctly, you should bunnyhop in the third screen (b-06) and be able to grab the far-left wall. From here, neutral jump/climb up to around the height of where the berry is like so:

This gives you a consistent visual cue of what a good height is to walljump off of the wall here. When the left fireball gets around to or just slightly underneath this line, walljump off the wall. In order to get the most out of your dashes, you want to use your first upright dash as late as you can - a good visual cue for this would be when you get just above the left fireball:

This should allow you to clear the second wave of fireballs. Once you just get past the second wave, up right dash once more and climbjump at the end to get to the other side, completing the strat.

There are some scenarios that you need to keep in mind when attempting this strat; sometimes you will go too fast into the third screen and sometimes you will go too slow. In the case that you are going too fast, after you bunnyhop in the third screen, pull back by turning right to slow down. As long as you aren’t going extremely fast, you will slow down enough to clear the fireballs once more. If you’re going too slow, you will need to bunnyhop quite late to maximise your distance, like so:

Reacting to whether you have too much, too little or just the right amount of speed is the key to being consistent at ice skip, and you will only truly grasp that with a lot of practice.

The second strat involves hypering off the ground combined with the coreblock momentum.

To start, dash into the side of the block whilst you're on the ground and input a short hyper (as in press dash and jump close together) when the block oscillates back far enough so you're back on the ground whilst still grabbing. Holding jump into the next screen, you want to ultra when you reach the first dash crystal.

After bunnyhopping, let go of jump at the second dash crystal and don't touch it until the next screen's bunnyhop.

Once you bunnyhop in the next screen, hold jump until Madeline reaches this point here, i.e. the first column of fireballs:

In doing all this correctly, you will be able to avoid dying to any of the fireballs and be able to grab the left wall like the former strat. From here, you climb up so that you're level with the berry and finish the strat in the same way. The timeloss in doing this method versus the former is that you end up lower on the far left wall, thus having to wait a cycle to grab the berry.

A fairly frustrating screen for new players, this is a very finicky screen that takes a decent amount of knowledge to get consistent at. 

On entry, you want to wavedash through the dash crystal to retain both of your dashes. This should give you enough distance to land on top of the center bumper. Bounce on this bumper once more on the top right of it and up right dash into the opening where the berry is. If you don’t get enough distance off of the second bounce, be ready to cornerjump out of the diagonal dash. If you get too much distance, be ready to up dash into the opening.

Once you grab the berry, you want to fall onto the side of the right bumper and boost off of it. If you do this successfully, you should get decently far to the left of the screen. At that point, you have a dash still that you use to diagonal dash to the left bumper. You can either bounce on the left side of the bumper which will be the faster but riskier option or bounce on the top of the bumper and go over the top of the left part. Going over the top is a lot safer but about half a second slower so only go under if you're comfortable with it as dying there is quite costly.

### c-03

There's a myriad of strats that you can do in this screen but for this guide, I'll be highlighting what I think is the easiest but also decently fast strat of the bunch.

After the hyper bunnyhop into ultra at the start of the screen, the rest is very straightforward and not precise at all. The only way you mess this up is not grabbing the dash crystal at the beginning so just make sure to keep your hyper bunnyhop tight and don't crouch for the bunnyhop so your hitbox is bigger.
