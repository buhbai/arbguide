### 06-b

There are a number of strats that you can do for this screen that are a little slower than the optimal strat but is a fair bit easier which I'll be covering in this section. The first of which is almost the same as the optimal strat, just a slower entry with a reverse hyper instead of a demohyper. This is .2 slower than optimal.

The second one involves a dashjump on entry instead of a hyper into a demohyper then a quick left dash to kill your momentum. This is around .3 slower than optimal.

Third strat involves a dashjump on entry like the previous but instead, you dashjump off the first platform with a late jump and hold jump for a decent amount. This is around .4 slower than optimal.

Test out all of these and see which you prefer. You want a strat where you consistently do not die over a strat that's a little faster but is more susceptible to dying.

### 05-c to 07-b or "Jasig"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/31.webp)

Very feel-based strat, not really many cues to work with unfortunately but it saves 3 seconds so I'll try point out a few things to look out for. So the strat consists of a wavedash into two consecutive cornerboosts (I would recommend cornerboosting off the first corner then holding jump and cornerboosting off the second corner with your second jump button) and then an ultra, a bunnyhop and finally a coyote bunnyhop in the next screen. Getting the right speed out of the double cornerboost comes with practice and there aren't any cues for this, at least I don't use any nor know of any. Likewise, the ultra timing doesn't have a cue but thankfully, it is fairly lenient. A lot of the time, failing the strat will involve jumping too early out of the ultra and jumping off the laundry block that overhangs on the exit, which means the window for the jump input is smaller than it looks as there's less of a window for it to be buffered. Lastly, you have to jump off of coyote frames in the next screen (and stay crouched) in order to get enough distance to clear the rest of the screen.

### 12-x

Often times when you press the towels button here, you're on the button at different points of it everytime so sometimes, you won't be close enough to do the normal strat which involves a dashjump off of the little ledge to the right here. This helps to circumvent that by retrying as soon as you press the button, which will respawn you on the right. From here, you want to do an uphyper to the left and press right very quickly afterwards. This ends up being same speed to the normal strat.

### 12-x to 13-b

This cycle skip up to the heart is tricky if you don’t know what to look out for but with some cues, this is actually quite easy. Upon entering the 2nd screen in the video, climbjump up and get to the ceiling before dashing. This will make it so you are closer to the shaft you’re trying to climb up so you will be fast enough to beat the cycle. From there, up hyper and jump around where the first choke point is, as shown:

This is a good visual cue so you don’t up hyper too early or too late. From here, just use the momentum of the up hyper to get up to the second checkpoint. Don’t press left at any point in this cycle skip, it is not needed and will just complicate things. Once you get to the second chokepoint, climbjump up on the nub on the right then walljump off the left wall. This should get you past the dustbunny cycle and up to the platform at the top of the screen, saving 0.9s or so.

### 11-c or "Resort heart checkpoint"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/11.webp)

When going backwards through the exit of the Resort heart room, the game does not have a proper checkpoint set for this entrance and will instead place you in the upper half of this room, which happens to be an early section of the books path.  This skips a couple of screens, most importantly another visit to the main hub room and a conversation with Oshiro. Trivially easy to execute, all you need to do is jump or dash back into the previous room after exiting the heart room before the path can close behind you, and then save and quit during the heart collection cutscene (for full clear ILs, use a deathwarp instead - for full game runs, save and quitting saves ingame time over the deathwarp).  As a result, be mindful that the common Huge Mess order for ARB is Chests -> Towels -> Books as opposed to Chests -> Books -> Towels in any%.

### 04-d to 02-d or "Shaft skip route"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/81.webp)

Shaft skip can be implemented into the ARB run by collecting the two berries located in 03-b, doing 04-c backward, collecting the berry on the way back and then performing shaft skip itself in 04-d. Optimally this saves around 1.7s~.

I wouldn’t recommend using shaft skip in ARB unless you’re very confident in pulling it off first try with a decently quick setup every run since if you die once at the skip or take too long to setup the skip, you will instantly start losing time compared to a far easier route overall.

### roof03

This screen is quite troublesome and quite frankly, pretty annoying when it doesn't go correctly. The strat detailed here, being a climbjump into a reverse dashjump after landing on the spring, is not terribly difficult and also just as fast as a previous strat I found that used going up top after the keycoin rather than below.

### roof06

The inputs for this is pretty self-explanatory and simple but the screen is really long and difficult so all I can reasonably say is study the video and practice it a lot. Also, don't be afraid to wait out an Oshiro cycle if you're too slow or you happen to mess up as it's infinitely better than dying and having to do the screen on the death cycle. This saves a little over a second so I definitely think it's something worth considering adding.
