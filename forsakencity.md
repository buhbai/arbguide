### 6a to s0 or "Coffee Shop Jump"
There are two ways to do this strat now, one with a demohyper-bunnyhop, one with a dashjump, the former being the faster of the two and, with practice, the easier one.

I'll cover the dashjump strat first though.

There are four things to keep in mind and to look out for when attempting this:

1. Line yourself up with the corner in the texture of the ground here:

2. Do a late jump with coyote frames to get more height by the time you reach the transition edge.

3. Dash diagonally upright when you reach the corner of the coffee shop.

4. Wait a tiny bit after the transition to use the momentum of the diagonal dash, moving you up and right very slightly. Up dash once this speed drops off.

Now I'll cover the demohyper-bunnyhop strat.

There are three things to keep in mind and to look out for when attempting this:

1. Up hyper off the very bottom of the wall here, which will line you up for the demo hyper perfectly:

2. Dash diagonally upright when you reach the corner of the coffee shop.

3. Wait a tiny bit after the transition to use the momentum of the diagonal dash, moving you up and right very slightly. Up dash once this speed drops off.

### s1 or "City heart"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/39.webp)

This strat isn't necessarily unintuitive or difficult enough to to be included into the guide since I think one can understand it from just watching a run but there are some little quirks about it that aren't obvious at all that may end up making this not work. For instance, if you buffer the dashjumps for this strat (what I mean by this is buffer the jump input after the dash), it won't count as a left dash for the heart code. Knowing this, we want to jump late to prevent this from happening, like so: 

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/40.png)

The other little thing to consider for this strat is the last dash at the end; if you do the upleft dash too early/too far to the right of the screen, it won't count towards the heart code either. This is because the camera needs to scroll to the left a certain amount before the last dash can count. A good cue to use for this strat in particular is this:

Alternative strat for this room that breaks even to the strat above on average. Instead of dashjumping on the first metal block, you demohyper instead to make it still count as a left dash input but you get the speed of a hyper.

### 6b to 7z

Another strat utilising a visual cue, this time an object in the background. Here, we dash upright when we're around the traffic light to be able to cornerjump in the next screen and save a dash to break the ice wall quicker.

### 9c

In the bottom left of the video (and of every video), I have an input display - left bumper is my demo button. As you can see, I dash right with a normal dash and then demo hyper left. Some people may ask why I wouldn’t just do demo dashes right and left to make it simpler. The reason for this is that you can’t demo dash twice consecutively whilst crouched, you have to wait to uncrouch. This means that you need to do a normal horizontal dash across the platform to regain your dash then quickly demo hyper the other way to avoid either getting a dashjump or having to wait to uncrouch.

### 12

Pretty simple strat that looks daunting. Walk into the iceblock as it's falling and start fastfalling when you reach the poster in the background and buffer a jump.
