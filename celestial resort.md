There are a number of strats that you can do for this screen that are a little slower than the optimal strat but is a fair bit easier which I'll be covering in this section. The first of which is almost the same as the optimal strat, just a slower entry with a reverse hyper instead of a demohyper. This is .2 slower than optimal.

The second one involves a dashjump on entry instead of a hyper into a demohyper then a quick left dash to kill your momentum. This is around .3 slower than optimal.

Third strat involves a dashjump on entry like the previous but instead, you dashjump off the first platform with a late jump and hold jump for a decent amount. This is around .4 slower than optimal.

Test out all of these and see which you prefer. You want a strat where you consistently do not die over a strat that's a little faster but is more susceptible to dying.
