### a-02b
Two methods to do this demodash, the first being grabbing the side of the wall.

This involves a pixel lineup into a demodash through the spike wall to skip the screen almost entirely. To do this, you need to be stand on the far-right edge of the green block. Getting here consistently is quite finicky if you don't have a setup but luckily there is one. 

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/31.png)

Climb up to this point of the wall here and dash left twice, then fastfall. This will let you land on the right-side of the block every time. Once you land, downdash, what this does is prevents you from sliding to the left slightly when you try to jump afterwards. From here, do a maximum height jump and downdash whilst holding grab. This will allow you grab the side of the block one pixel above where you want to demodash. From here, release and repress grab quickly to move one pixel down so that you’re now grabbing the wall at this pixel:

Then it’s simply demodashing to the right. For this demo dash I recommend binding a different button to down + dash. This is because if you do it with a normal demo button, i.e. just another down input, you risk pressing the demo button before the dash and sliding down the wall before actually dashing, therefore rendering your pixel lineup obsolete. With a button bound to down and dash, all you need to do once you're grabbing the side of the green block is to hold right and press that button and it does the work for you.

The second method being doing a timed downright into a buffered demodash out of a max height jump like this:

Same as the other strat to begin with, climbing to that certain point of the rightmost wall then dashing left twice and fastfalling, only this time, you want to buffer a jump once you land. Afterwards, when Madeline reaches the gap between these two green streaks in the background crystal, this is when you want to dash downright:

The frame window for this isn't that small so with a bit of practice, you should be getting this consistent. Personally, I found this to be more consistent than the former strat and it's about .3 faster so if you can make this work, you should use it.

### d-01c

Falling through the dustbunny floor here is subpixel precise and to be frank, I couldn't get it to be completely consistent myself but I found this to be the best setup. After landing in the little alcove on the far right of the room, dash left then dash left again twice whilst staying neutral. Once you land on the lowering platform, short hyper and hold jump until you reach the left wall. From here, you want to dash downleft and grab the wall, then hold right and let go of the wall. If it's all done correctly, you should fall through the dustfloor and save about 1.3s or so over going for the bottom berry first.

### d-04

The demodash on this screen is pretty finnicky and wouldn't be surprised if top runners couldn't get this down consistently but throwing this in here anyway. Extend the hyper a bit on the previous screen then the wavedash on the next screen has to have a very late jump so that you can beat the moving dustbunny cycle. The visual cue I used for when to jump before the demodash was this skull in the background:

Kind of unintuitive but it saves about 0.8s so it's quite a large timesave, and dying once then getting this on the death cycle only loses around 1.7s to not going for this at all in the first place. Moreover, the death cycle is a lot easier than the entry since there's no dustbunny cycle to take into consideration so it only requires an extended hyper into buffered demo dash.

### e-11

Another subpixel precise strat here, this one being a lot more consistent than the previous one though. After entering the screen, you want to crouchjump to the left wall and hold jump until Madeline auto-adjusts to the top of the wall. This sets up your subpixel to one that works for the rest of the strat. From here, jump to the nook in the wall to your right, where you'll now be hanging off the bottom pixel, allowing you to walljump off and then cornerjump with your second jump button off of the corner immediately after that. You'll retain your two dashes this way and be able to get to the seeded screen without using the block. Altogether this saves around 2s so it's quite substantial.

### f-05

What once was a subpixel dependent strat is now just a matter of dashing around the middle of the screen transition. This strat saves around 4.6s so it's the biggest skip in the level. The dash through the transition is supposedly frame perfect but with a visual cue, it feels very consistent to me. After entering the bubble, go upleft until you reach this vine here: 

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/78.png)

From here, you want to dash upright and buffer an updash. This will put you in the middle of the transition ready for a transition uphyper. On the next screen, you want to jump but also hold left for the first few frames of the uphyper so that you don't get launched into the wall of spikes on the right but also not to launch into the wall of spikes on the left either. You retain both of your dashes this way and can simply up dash to the top without having to use the bubble from down below two screens.

### g-00b (Flag 21)

After grabbing the berry, grab the very top of the wall and then hold right like shown here:

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/79.png)

This will set you up so you can climbjump off the corner at the bottom and be able to reach the crumble block platform without using the spring, saving a few milliseconds if done well.
