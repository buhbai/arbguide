## Introduction
This guide will be giving a detailed rundown on the advanced strategies that aren’t fully self explanatory in the ARB run. It is not a full route guide, you can watch any top runner’s PB for that. This is aimed at runners that already have experience with the game itself, either with ILing or with running Any%, therefore I will not be explaining the speedtech and basic mechanics of the game and assume you know all of that already.

I will be labelling each screen by its ID denoted in debug mode (screens that are visited more than once or are large that need specifying where in the screen the strat is are shown with “(x)” next to their ID). If you have any questions about anything specific that needs more elaboration than I’ve already given here, then DM me on discord @buhbai#7271. **This guide is a constant WIP** - if you feel like a strat needs to be further explained and deserves to be in the guide then also DM me and I’ll consider adding it.

## Berry mechanics

### Berry collection

To quote euni: “To collect a berry you must: 
- Be on safe ground for 9 consecutive frames
- Be on safe ground for 18 total frames if you had another berry when you picked up the berry you’re trying to collect.”

This means that collecting more than one berry at once ends up taking twice as long as as collecting just one, which can throw off your timing and potentially lose a berry by retrying or returning to map too quickly for instance; keep this in mind.

### Winged berry

Floating berry that flies away once you dash on that particular screen. The hitbox of winged berries oscillate up and down on a cycle as opposed to the static hitbox of normal berries.

### Seeded berry

A berry that spawns once all the berry seeds that make it up are collected on that particular screen. You can skip the cutscene of the berry spawning.

### Berry seeds

Floating seeds that are dropped when you come into contact with the ground. You have 9 frames on the ground for seeds to reset, but they'll reset immediately if you move upward from the ground, e.g. dash up/diagonal dash up or jump.

## Heart route

Collecting 4 hearts is required in the ARB run to access the Core and collect the final 5 berries and complete the run. The recommended route for beginners was collecting the hearts in 1A to 4A as they are the quickest of the A-Sides. This allows you to do 6A which is a lot more forgiving and is more comfortable for most runners than 6B as it is part of the current recommended Any% route. 

However, 6B is used in the heart route that is considerably faster than the beginner route simply because you skip having to collect a heart in the A-Side for the same time frame, since 6B is just as fast (if not faster, depending on what you get for 6A times on average) than 6A and 6A doesn’t contain any berries. This is why we can go to 6A, collect the cassette and quit to play 6B and unlock Summit that way.

If you plan on running with 6B, the slowest of the 4 A-Side hearts is Old Site, which takes around 19.3s to collect. This means that doing the 6B route, as long as you get a time that is equivalent to a time doing the 6A route, saves at least 19.3s, not including the time you can potentially save over better execution of 6B over 6A and what not.

A question that comes up a lot is “So when should I be playing 6B?” I would say the best time to start playing 6B would be when it’s difficult for you to improve your 6A average anymore and when your 6B time is up to the level of your 6A at least. This means you can either start playing 6B from the get go and get a headstart at getting comfortable with the level or wait until you’ve gotten a few PBs under your belt; the choice is yours.

## Forsaken City

### 6a to s0 or "Coffee Shop Jump"
There are two ways to do this strat now, one with a demohyper-bunnyhop, one with a dashjump, the former being the faster of the two and, with practice, the easier one.

I'll cover the dashjump strat first though.

![Image of Coffee Shop Jump](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/1.webp)

There are four things to keep in mind and to look out for when attempting this:

1. Line yourself up with the corner in the texture of the ground here:

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/2.png)

2. Do a late jump with coyote frames to get more height by the time you reach the transition edge.

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/3.png)

3. Dash diagonally upright when you reach the corner of the coffee shop.

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/4.png)

4. Wait a tiny bit after the transition to use the momentum of the diagonal dash, moving you up and right very slightly. Up dash once this speed drops off.

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/5.webp)

Now I'll cover the demohyper-bunnyhop strat.

![Image of Coffee Shop Jump](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/30.webp)

There are three things to keep in mind and to look out for when attempting this:

1. Up hyper off the very bottom of the wall here, which will line you up for the demo hyper perfectly: 

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/29.png)

2. Dash diagonally upright when you reach the corner of the coffee shop.

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/4.png)

3. Wait a tiny bit after the transition to use the momentum of the diagonal dash, moving you up and right very slightly. Up dash once this speed drops off.

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/5.webp)

### s1 or "City heart"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/39.webp)

This strat isn't necessarily unintuitive or difficult enough to to be included into the guide since I think one can understand it from just watching a run but there are some little quirks about it that aren't obvious at all that may end up making this not work. For instance, if you buffer the dashjumps for this strat (what I mean by this is buffer the jump input after the dash), it won't count as a left dash for the heart code. Knowing this, we want to jump late to prevent this from happening, like so: 

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/40.png)

The other little thing to consider for this strat is the last dash at the end; if you do the upleft dash too early/too far to the right of the screen, it won't count towards the heart code either. This is because the camera needs to scroll to the left a certain amount before the last dash can count. A good cue to use for this strat in particular is this: 

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/41.png)

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/44.webp)

Alternative strat for this room that breaks even to the strat above on average. Instead of dashjumping on the first metal block, you demohyper instead to make it still count as a left dash input but you get the speed of a hyper.

### 6b to 7z

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/46.webp)

Another strat utilising a visual cue, this time an object in the background. Here, we dash upright when we're around the traffic light to be able to cornerjump in the next screen and save a dash to break the ice wall quicker. 

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/59.png)

### 9c

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/6.webp)

In the bottom left of the video (and of every video), I have an input display - left bumper is my demo button. As you can see, I dash right with a normal dash and then demo hyper left. Some people may ask why I wouldn’t just do demo dashes right and left to make it simpler. The reason for this is that you can’t demo dash twice consecutively whilst crouched, you have to wait to uncrouch. This means that you need to do a normal horizontal dash across the platform to regain your dash then quickly demo hyper the other way to avoid either getting a dashjump or having to wait to uncrouch.

### 12

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/45.webp)

Pretty simple strat that looks daunting. Walk into the iceblock as it's falling and start fastfalling when you reach the poster in the background and buffer a jump.

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/60.png)

## Old Site

### d4 (Entry)

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/47.webp)

Uses a demodash or a downright dash when dashing into the dreamblock to retain crouched state and avoid bonking on the little nub sticking out and potentially killing you. This also is a bit faster because you end up higher on the wall.

### d4 (Return)

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/48.webp)

This is pretty lenient but having a visual cue is safer so here it is; you also tend to enter this room with a nonzero amount of berries so you definitely don't want to risk dying. Downleft dash when you reach the green pixels highlighted here:

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/61.png)

### end_3c

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/7.webp)

To line this spike cornerjump correctly, you need to jump off the edge of this platform here: 

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/8.png)

In order to set this up quickly from entry, from the first up hyper, go neutral and then up hyper off the left wall. Neutral off of this up hyper also and then walljump off the right wall and hold left. This is shown in the input display. Doing all of this correctly will line you up to jump off the edge of the platform when you land on the next screen, thus setting up the spike cornerjump itself.

## Celestial Resort

### 05-c to 07-b or "Jasig"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/31.webp)

Very feel-based strat, not really many cues to work with unfortunately but it saves 3 seconds so I'll try point out a few things to look out for. So the strat consists of a wavedash into two consecutive cornerboosts (I would recommend cornerboosting off the first corner then holding jump and cornerboosting off the second corner with your second jump button) and then an ultra, a bunnyhop and finally a coyote bunnyhop in the next screen. Getting the right speed out of the double cornerboost comes with practice and there aren't any cues for this, at least I don't use any nor know of any. Likewise, the ultra timing doesn't have a cue but thankfully, it is fairly lenient. A lot of the time, failing the strat will involve jumping too early out of the ultra and jumping off the laundry block that overhangs on the exit, which means the window for the jump input is smaller than it looks as there's less of a window for it to be buffered. Lastly, you have to jump off of coyote frames in the next screen (and stay crouched) in order to get enough distance to clear the rest of the screen.


### 12-x to 13-b

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/9.webp)

This cycle skip up to the heart is tricky if you don’t know what to look out for but with some cues, this is actually quite easy. Upon entering the 2nd screen in the video, climbjump up and get to the ceiling before dashing. This will make it so you are closer to the shaft you’re trying to climb up so you will be fast enough to beat the cycle. From there, up hyper and jump around where the first choke point is, as shown: 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/10.png)

This is a good visual cue so you don’t up hyper too early or too late. From here, just use the momentum of the up hyper to get up to the second checkpoint. Don’t press left at any point in this cycle skip, it is not needed and will just complicate things. Once you get to the second chokepoint, climbjump up on the nub on the right then walljump off the left wall. This should get you past the dustbunny cycle and up to the platform at the top of the screen, saving 0.9s or so.

### 11-c or "Resort heart checkpoint"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/11.webp)

When going backwards through the exit of the Resort heart room, the game does not have a proper checkpoint set for this entrance and will instead place you in the upper half of this room, which happens to be an early section of the books path.  This skips a couple of screens, most importantly another visit to the main hub room and a conversation with Oshiro.  Trivially easy to execute, all you need to do is jump or dash back into the previous room after exiting the heart room before the path can close behind you, and then save and quit during the heart collection cutscene (for full clear ILs, use a deathwarp instead - for full game runs, save and quitting saves ingame time over the deathwarp).  As a result, be mindful that the common Huge Mess order for ARB is Chests -> Towels -> Books as opposed to Chests -> Books -> Towels in any%.

### 04-d to 02-d or "Shaft skip route"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/12.webp)

Shaft skip can be implemented into the ARB run by collecting the two berries located in 03-b, doing 04-c backwards and then performing shaft skip itself in 04-d. Optimally this saves around 0.6 to 0.8s depending on how fast your shaft skip setup is. Also, doing the berry in 04-d on the way to the key room instead of on the way to the shaft skip room is 0.2s faster but doing the optimal strat to collect the berry on the way to the key room is considerably harder than just collecting it when doing the screen backwards. This means that overall, the skip can save anywhere between 0.4s and 0.8s. 

I wouldn’t recommend using shaft skip in ARB unless you’re very confident in pulling it off first try with a decently quick setup every run since if you die once at the skip or take too long to setup the skip, you will instantly start losing time compared to a far easier route overall. 

It’s also not as cool as the route with the quad hyper screen :)

## Golden Ridge

### b-sec(2) or "Blockless heart"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/13.webp)

This strat involves an up hyper and a cornerjump; the setup is quite precise when starting out but with practice, this becomes very easy when you rely on muscle memory. To begin with, reverse dashjump and then do one full climbjump on the wall. Here is where the tricky part of the strat begins.

The up hyper needs to be off of the maximum distance from a wall that the player can wall jump off of and not off of the wall itself. You must also jump off the very bottom of this corner. You can see this here: 

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/14.png)

To setup the alignment you need to jump off of the maximum distance off of this corner, up dash when you reach this visual cue: 

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/15.png)

Up dashing roughly around this corner in the background tiles will align you nicely. From there, don’t move left or right until you actually jump. Once you jump, just hold it off of the up hyper then cornerjump using your second jump button, still holding your first jump button, and dash into the heart after bouncing on it.

Even with these pointers, it will take a lot of practice to get it down to muscle memory and to a point where you can get this consistently first try but it is worth learning. You save roughly 4s with this first try and each attempt costs about 2.5s so you would still be saving time second try and only be losing around 0.5s to using the white block on the third try. Knowing all this, I would only recommend implementing this into full runs when you can get this 1-in-3 tries every time without fail.

### b-08 or "First blockless"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/29.webp)

Utilises a tech that's only really used in TAS called a "ceiling pop", which enables you to essentially climbjump off the bottom of a wall just after slipping off of it, giving you a tiny bit of distance and height. 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/30.png)

To do this, get into the little crevice of the wall as shown here and climbjump up once so that you are flush with the top of it. What this does is reset your subpixel to .00 so that the ceiling pop doesn't get affected by subpixels. Once you're at the top, simply let go of grab and hold right, making you slide down the wall slowly. Finally, input a climbjump when you're near the bottom of the wall and you should be able to successfully perform a ceiling pop. 

Once you get the hang of that, it's the easy part. The hard part is the diagonal dash into cornerjump after the ceiling pop, which is a 2-frame window with a diagonal dash and a 4-frame window with a diagonal demo dash. Sounds difficult but it is easier than it sounds as you're approaching that window in the same way every time so there are no variables affecting you leading up to it really, it just becomes a timing issue which you can get consistent at. 

This saves 4-5s in ARB roughly, depending on what your previous strat was. This also goes around even/loses 1s second try depending on where you fail the strat so if you can get it 50% of the time at least then I would say it is worth considering implementing. 

### c-06b

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/16.webp)

This uses a fairly easy setup to guarantee landing on the safe ground here that loses 0.2-0.3s to using no setup. As soon as you touch the dash crystal, dash up and hold right and you should land and collect the berry.

### c-08

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/33.webp)

The cycle skip in this screen looks like an overly precise one but with the right cue, it becomes a fairly trivial screen and saves quite a large chunk of time for how simple of a screen it is due to wind cycles. All the strat consists of is entering the second bubble when the wind cycle is just starting up again for the second cycle and buffering your dashes out of it. From there, hold left and jump off the corner and you'll have successfully saved 2.5s~ over the next fastest strat.

## Mirror Temple

### a-06

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/34.webp)

Quite an unintuitive strat for how simple and easy it looks but deceivingly difficult if you don't know what you're doing. After activating the button, do a grounded ultra then hold just down. 

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/36.png)

Once you get to around the corner of the white outline here, diagonal dash into the dashblock, go directionless and jump late and you won't get flung into any of the spikes and save around .3s.

### b-06 or "Crouched bubble skip"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/17.webp)

Utilises the property of being in crouch state when entering bubbles moving you up 2 pixels, which gives you just enough height to grab onto the lip of the wall. An easy way to enter the bubble in crouch state is to just crouch underneath the bubble and jump into it whilst holding down. A good visual cue for when to dash up out of the bubble is when you reach the gold candle on the wall. Once you up dash out of the bubble, you need to wait a millisecond before going for the grab to gain a very small amount of height. If you try to grab the wall as soon as you dash out, you will not reach the wall.

### c-10

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/37.webp)

This strat is a lot easier if you walk on entry, due to seeker manipulation malarkey. Upon entering the screen, down dash here, at the rightmost point of the red vine in the background: 

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/38.png)

Once you land on the platform, reverse hyper. The reverse hyper is important because once you land here, to get the seeker to dash to the top coin instead of at you, you need to wait on the platform for a certain amount of time, and that amount of time just so happens to be the time it takes to perform a reverse hyper. Alternatively, if you aren't comfortable with reverse hypers yet, you can just wait for a little bit then do a hyper but a reverse hyper also helps with making the cornerboost afterwards more lenient.

### d-15 (Upper Area) 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/18.webp)

This simply involves an extended hyper into a buffered demo dash. I recommend holding your demo button down for the entire strat so you can do an extended demo hyper into a demo dash which cuts the inputs needed. It is also important to hold jump out of the demo hyper right up until you demodash, else you won’t get enough height. Takes some practice and getting used to but isn’t all too bad once you understand it and play around with it. You break even with going over the top with second try so I would only implement this into full game when you can get it first or second try every time without fail.

### d-04 (Lower Area)

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/19.webp)

Involving an ultra into a spikejump, this strat skips this screen almost entirely and allows you to get through it much quicker than the intended route. The only important part is when you ultra, the rest is fairly simple. 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/20.png)

This shows around about where you will want to be ultraing from out of the bubble - you want to ultra from the right half of this gold candle roughly. If you ultra later, you will dash into the spike floor. Once you ultra, do not hold down and you should be able to grab onto the side of the corner. From there, simply climbjump into the bubble.

Now that you’re in the bubble, all you have to do is move up with the bubble and quickly dash up out of it. This will make you grab the berry just barely whilst also breaking the bubble a lot sooner than if you were to continue with the bubble all the way to the ceiling, meaning the bubble will also respawn sooner. When you grab the berry, do not fast fall into the bubble, slow falling into it perfectly lands you inside it as it spawns. From there, you just head for the bubble near the exit.

## The Summit

### a-02b

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/21.webp)

This involves a pixel lineup into a demodash through the spike wall to skip the screen almost entirely. To do this, you need to be stand on the far-right edge of the green block. Getting here consistently is quite finicky if you don't have a setup but luckily there is one. 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/31.png)

Climb up to this point of the wall here and dash left twice, then fastfall. This will let you land on the right-side of the block every time. Once you land, downdash, what this does is prevents you from sliding to the left slightly when you try to jump afterwards. From here, do a maximum height jump and downdash whilst holding grab. This will allow you grab the side of the block one pixel above where you want to demodash. From here, release and repress grab quickly to move one pixel down so that you’re now grabbing the wall at this pixel:

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/22.png)

Then it’s simply demodashing to the right. For this demo dash I recommend binding a different button to down + dash. This is because if you do it with a normal demo button, i.e. just another down input, you risk pressing the demo button before the dash and sliding down the wall before actually dashing, therefore rendering your pixel lineup obsolete. With a button bound to down and dash, all you need to do once you're grabbing the side of the green block is to hold right and press that button and it does the work for you.

### d-04

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/42.webp)

The demodash on this screen is pretty finnicky and wouldn't be surprised if top runners couldn't get this down consistently but throwing this in here anyway. Extend the hyper a bit on the previous screen then the wavedash on the next screen has to have a very late jump so that you can beat the moving dustbunny cycle. The visual cue I used for when to jump before the demodash was this skull in the background: 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/43.png)

Kind of unintuitive but it saves about 0.8s so it's quite a large timesave, and dying once then getting this on the death cycle only loses around 1.7s to not going for this at all in the first place. Moreover, the death cycle is a lot easier than the entry since there's no dustbunny cycle to take into consideration so it only requires an extended hyper into buffered demo dash.

## Core

### b-01 to b-06 or "Ice Skip"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/23.webp)

Ice skip involves a reverse hyper off of a fire core block into an ultra, followed by a bunnyhop into a cornerboost in the next screen, followed by another ultra in that same screen to launch yourself across the third screen and onto the wall with both of your dashes in tact. Difficult at first but with practice, it becomes a very easy strat to get consistently. Definitely learn this before doing runs, it saves roughly 35s over the intended route, meaning you can probably get a 5th try ice skip and still save time or at least break even.

Wait for the fire core block to wind up then reverse hyper to get the full speed boost. Reverse hyper quickly and ultra right after. This should conserve your momentum well. In the next screen (b-00), you want to delay your bunnyhop slightly so that you get a good angle for cornerboosting off the small ledge. Once you bunnyhop, hold jump and immediately jump whilst holding grab with your second jump button to cornerboost. 

Once you cornerboost, you want to ultra around where the second dash crystal is, since that's usually when you're at the apex of the bunnyhop: 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/24.png)

If you do it all correctly, you should bunnyhop in the third screen (b-06) and be able to grab the far-left wall. From here, neutral jump/climb up to around the height of where the berry is like so: 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/25.png)

This gives you a consistent visual cue of what a good height is to walljump off of the wall here. When the left fireball gets around to or just slightly underneath this line, walljump off the wall. In order to get the most out of your dashes, you want to use your first upright dash as late as you can - a good visual cue for this would be when you get just above the left fireball: 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/26.png)

This should allow you to clear the second wave of fireballs. Once you just get past the second wave, up right dash once more and climbjump at the end to get to the other side, completing the strat.

There are some scenarios that you need to keep in mind when attempting this strat; sometimes you will go too fast into the third screen and sometimes you will go too slow. In the case that you are going too fast, after you bunnyhop in the third screen, pull back by turning right to slow down. As long as you aren’t going extremely fast, you will slow down enough to clear the fireballs once more. If you’re going too slow, you will need to bunnyhop quite late to maximise your distance, like so:

Reacting to whether you have too much, too little or just the right amount of speed is the key to being consistent at ice skip, and you will only truly grasp that with a lot of practice.

A fairly frustrating screen for new players, this is a very finicky screen that takes a decent amount of knowledge to get consistent at. 

On entry, you want to wavedash through the dash crystal to retain both of your dashes. This should give you enough distance to land on top of the center bumper. Bounce on this bumper once more on the top right of it and up right dash into the opening where the berry is. If you don’t get enough distance off of the second bounce, be ready to cornerjump out of the diagonal dash. If you get too much distance, be ready to up dash into the opening.

Once you grab the berry, you want to fall onto the side of the right bumper and boost off of it. If you do this successfully, you should get decently far to the left of the screen. At that point, you have a dash still that you use to diagonal dash to the left bumper. You can either bounce on the left side of the bumper which will be the faster but riskier option or bounce on the top of the bumper and go over the top of the left part. Going over the top is a lot safer but about half a second slower so only go under if you're comfortable with it as dying there is quite costly.

## Closing words and credits

Hopefully this has been useful to you and has made the majority of these strats easier to learn and implement into your own runs. Good luck!

Thanks to Evansfight for proof reading.

Thanks to czyys' dustforce guide for this format and using github in general. A lot better to format than google docs.
