## Introduction
This guide will be giving a detailed rundown on the advanced strategies that aren’t fully self explanatory in the ARB run. It is not a full route guide, you can watch any top runner’s PB for that. This is aimed at runners that already have experience with the game itself, either with ILing or with running Any%, therefore I will not be explaining the speedtech and basic mechanics of the game and assume you know all of that already.

I will be labelling each screen by its ID denoted in debug mode (screens that are visited more than once or are large that need specifying where in the screen the strat is are shown with “(x)” next to their ID). If you have any questions about anything specific that needs more elaboration than I’ve already given here, then DM me on discord @buhbai#7271. **This guide is a constant WIP** - if you feel like a strat needs to be further explained and deserves to be in the guide then also DM me and I’ll consider adding it.

Please use the document outline on the left to navigate through the guide a lot easier. If you can’t see it, go to View -> Show document outline in the top left.

## Berry mechanics

### Berry collection

To quote euni: “To collect a berry you must: 
- Be on safe ground for 9 consecutive frames
- Be on safe ground for 18 total frames if you had another berry when you picked up the berry you’re trying to collect.”

This means that collecting more than one berry at once ends up taking twice as long as as collecting just one, which can throw off your timing and potentially lose a berry by retrying or returning to map too quickly for instance; keep this in mind.

### Winged berry

Floating berry that flies away once you dash on that particular screen. The hitbox of winged berries oscillate up and down on a cycle as opposed to the static hitbox of normal berries.

### Seeded berry

A berry that spawns once all the berry seeds that make it up are collected on that particular screen. You can skip the cutscene of the berry spawning.

### Berry seeds

Floating seeds that are dropped when you come into contact with the ground. You have 9 frames on the ground for seeds to reset, but they'll reset immediately if you move upward from the ground, e.g. dash up/diagonal dash up or jump.

## Heart route

Collecting 4 hearts is required in the ARB run to access the Core and collect the final 5 berries and complete the run. The recommended route for beginners was collecting the hearts in 1A to 4A as they are the quickest of the A-Sides. This allows you to do 6A which is a lot more forgiving and is more comfortable for most runners than 6B as it is part of the current recommended Any% route. 

However, 6B is used in the heart route that is considerably faster than the beginner route simply because you skip having to collect a heart in the A-Side for the same time frame, since 6B is just as fast (if not faster, depending on what you get for 6A times on average) than 6A and 6A doesn’t contain any berries. This is why we can go to 6A, collect the cassette and quit to play 6B and unlock Summit that way.

If you plan on running with 6B, the slowest of the 4 A-Side hearts is Old Site, which takes around 19.3s to collect. This means that doing the 6B route, as long as you get a time that is equivalent to a time doing the 6A route, saves at least 19.3s, not including the time you can potentially save over better execution of 6B over 6A and what not.

A question that comes up a lot is “So when should I be playing 6B?” I would say the best time to start playing 6B would be when it’s difficult for you to improve your 6A average anymore and when your 6B time is up to the level of your 6A at least. This means you can either start playing 6B from the get go and get a headstart at getting comfortable with the level or wait until you’ve gotten a few PBs under your belt; the choice is yours.

## Forsaken City

### 6a to s0 or "Coffee Shop Jump"

There are four things to keep in mind and to look out for when attempting this:

1. Line yourself up with the corner in the texture of the ground here:

2. Do a late jump with coyote frames to get more height by the time you reach the transition edge.

3. Dash diagonally upright when you reach the corner of the coffee shop.

4. Wait a tiny bit after the transition to use the momentum of the diagonal dash, moving you up and right very slightly. Up dash once this speed drops off.

### 9c

In the bottom left of the gif (and of every gif), I have an input display - left bumper is my demo button. As you can see, I dash right with a normal dash and then demo hyper left. Some people may ask why I wouldn’t just do demo dashes right and left to make it simpler. The reason for this is that you can’t demo dash twice consecutively whilst crouched, you have to wait to uncrouch. This means that you need to do a normal horizontal dash across the platform to regain your dash then quickly demo hyper the other way to avoid either getting a dashjump or having to wait to uncrouch.

## Old Site

### end_3c

To line this spike cornerjump correctly, you need to jump off the edge of this platform here: 

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/8.png)

In order to set this up quickly from entry, from the first up hyper, go neutral and then up hyper off the left wall. Neutral off of this up hyper also and then walljump off the right wall and hold left. This is shown in the input display. Doing all of this correctly will line you up to jump off the edge of the platform when you land on the next screen, thus setting up the spike cornerjump itself.
