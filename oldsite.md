### d4 (Entry)

Uses a demodash or a downright dash when dashing into the dreamblock to retain crouched state and avoid bonking on the little nub sticking out and potentially killing you. This also is a bit faster because you end up higher on the wall.

### d4 (Return)

This is pretty lenient but having a visual cue is safer so here it is; you also tend to enter this room with a nonzero amount of berries so you definitely don't want to risk dying. Downleft dash when you reach the green pixels highlighted here:

To line this spike cornerjump correctly, you need to jump off the edge of this platform here:

In order to set this up quickly from entry, from the first up hyper, go neutral and then up hyper off the left wall. Neutral off of this up hyper also and then walljump off the right wall and hold left. This is shown in the input display. Doing all of this correctly will line you up to jump off the edge of the platform when you land on the next screen, thus setting up the spike cornerjump itself.
