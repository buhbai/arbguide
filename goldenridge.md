### a-09

Skipping the wind cycle here saves quite a bit of time and there's a few ways you can accomplish this but I believe this is the simplest and easiest version with a bit of practice. It involves climbing to the top of the suspended wall in the middle, full climbjumping over and turning right at a certain point to barely grab the berry without dying in the process. 

When you reach the x-coordinate of the first wall that jutts out from the ceiling, as shown in the image here:

That's when you want to press right.

### b-sec(2) or "Blockless heart"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/13.webp)

This strat involves an up hyper and a cornerjump; the setup is quite precise when starting out but with practice, this becomes very easy when you rely on muscle memory. To begin with, reverse dashjump and then do one full climbjump on the wall. Here is where the tricky part of the strat begins.

The up hyper needs to be off of the maximum distance from a wall that the player can wall jump off of and not off of the wall itself. You must also jump off the very bottom of this corner. You can see this here: 

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/14.png)

To setup the alignment you need to jump off of the maximum distance off of this corner, up dash when you reach this visual cue: 

![Image of visual cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/15.png)

Up dashing roughly around this corner in the background tiles will align you nicely. From there, don’t move left or right until you actually jump. Once you jump, just hold it off of the up hyper then cornerjump using your second jump button, still holding your first jump button, and dash into the heart after bouncing on it.

Even with these pointers, it will take a lot of practice to get it down to muscle memory and to a point where you can get this consistently first try but it is worth learning. You save roughly 4s with this first try and each attempt costs about 2.5s so you would still be saving time second try and only be losing around 0.5s to using the white block on the third try. Knowing all this, I would only recommend implementing this into full runs when you can get this 1-in-3 tries every time without fail.

### b-08 or "First blockless"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/29.webp)

Utilises a tech that's only really used in TAS called a "ceiling pop", which enables you to essentially climbjump off the bottom of a wall just after slipping off of it, giving you a tiny bit of distance and height. 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/30.png)

To do this, get into the little crevice of the wall as shown here and climbjump up once so that you are flush with the top of it. What this does is reset your subpixel to .00 so that the ceiling pop doesn't get affected by subpixels. Once you're at the top, simply let go of grab and hold right, making you slide down the wall slowly. Finally, input a climbjump when you're near the bottom of the wall and you should be able to successfully perform a ceiling pop. 

Once you get the hang of that, it's the easy part. The hard part is the diagonal dash into cornerjump after the ceiling pop, which is a 2-frame window with a diagonal dash and a 4-frame window with a diagonal demo dash. Sounds difficult but it is easier than it sounds as you're approaching that window in the same way every time so there are no variables affecting you leading up to it really, it just becomes a timing issue which you can get consistent at. 

This saves 4-5s in ARB roughly, depending on what your previous strat was. This also goes around even/loses 1s second try depending on where you fail the strat so if you can get it 50% of the time at least then I would say it is worth considering implementing.

### c-00 or "Under trail"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/57.webp)

A really difficult strat this one, I wouldn't recommend implementing this unless you're going for world record to be honest but have at it and give it a go if you want to see how it feels or just want to play around with the strat. Saves up to .9 but takes a lot of practice to get comfortable with. 

Firstly out of the bubble, you want to upright dash and reverse climbjump to get to the very top of this little indent in the wall, like so:

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/63.png)

From here, you want to neutral jump over the lip and then buffer a full jump to the right; you want to hold right for longer than you think. Once you believe you're able to cornerjump off the next wall over, keep holding jump and right and cornerjump with your second jump button. If you did everything correctly, you should get a cornerjump, which you can then climbjump up the wall and enter the bubble like normal. It's a pretty feel-based strat and you just need to ram your head into it a bunch until you start getting it if you want to use it in runs.

### c-06b

This uses a fairly easy setup to guarantee landing on the safe ground here that loses 0.2-0.3s to using no setup. As soon as you touch the dash crystal, dash up and hold right and you should land and collect the berry.

### c-08

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/33.webp)

The cycle skip in this screen looks like an overly precise one but with the right cue, it becomes a fairly trivial screen and saves quite a large chunk of time for how simple of a screen it is due to wind cycles. All the strat consists of is entering the second bubble when the wind cycle is just starting up again for the second cycle and buffering your dashes out of it. From there, hold left and jump off the corner and you'll have successfully saved 2.5s~ over the next fastest strat.

### d-07 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/58.webp)

Not a very difficult strat here really but it's kind of risky because you have no real opportunity to collect the berry until the end of the screen here, or the end of the next screen if you want to stay optimal so only go for it if you are confident I would say. You want to hug the left wall after you grab the berry for spacing and to do that, you want to delay your jump input after exiting the bubble initially and neutral jump off of the left wall instead of uphypering. From there, when you reach the bottom of the wall like so:

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/64.png)

Demodash to the right, turn around and climbjump off the wall, or walljump off the wall, whatever you think is easier.
