### a-06

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/34.webp)

Quite an unintuitive strat for how simple and easy it looks but deceivingly difficult if you don't know what you're doing. After activating the button, do a grounded ultra then hold just down.

Once you get to around the corner of the white outline here, diagonal dash into the dashblock, go directionless and jump late and you won't get flung into any of the spikes and save around .3s.

### a-10

Involves an extended hyper/wavedash and a quick but not buffered ultra. The coyote jump off the dashblock is the hard part and I used two cues for it, one being the sound cue of landing on the block and also this visual cue of where to jump from:

### b-17

Fairly difficult strat, mainly the entry is the only hard part. You need to be standing at the far left of the floor before the screen transition, extended dashjump and buffer an upright; the window for this upright is tight. On the seeded berry screen, you want to cornerjump off of the immediate wall hanging over the entrance then climb up until you can walljump off and reach the dashblock with an upright. After landing, you want to extended hyper, and more importantly, jump off of coyote frames with this, like shown here: 

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/76.png)

You want to do this because if you jump early i.e. off of the block, it would count as jumping off of ground which, as I explained at the beginning of the guide, would make you lose your seeds. However, if you jump off of coyote frames, the game would count that as jumping off the air essentially and so you will retain your berry seeds.

### b-03

The demodash through the spikes here is pretty easy as there's a fairly large frame window as long as you're holding jump the whole time during the hyper. There's also a good visual cue for when to demodash - at this candle here:

### c-08

Hyper before the transition, cornerboost on the lip on the next screen and fast fall onto the 1 tile platform then short hyper off until you're underneath the edge of the platform in the middle of the room like so:

This will make it so the seeker dashes into the ground quickly and recover so that they're in line of sight of you sooner than most other cases - saves about .5s.

### b-06 or "Crouched bubble skip"

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/17.webp)

Utilises the property of being in crouch state when entering bubbles moving you up 2 pixels, which gives you just enough height to grab onto the lip of the wall. An easy way to enter the bubble in crouch state is to just crouch underneath the bubble and jump into it whilst holding down. A good visual cue for when to dash up out of the bubble is when you reach the gold candle on the wall. Once you up dash out of the bubble, you need to wait a millisecond before going for the grab to gain a very small amount of height. If you try to grab the wall as soon as you dash out, you will not reach the wall.

### c-10

This strat is a lot easier if you walk on entry, due to seeker manipulation malarkey. Upon entering the screen, down dash here, at the rightmost point of the red vine in the background: 

![Image of cue](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/38.png)

Once you land on the platform, reverse hyper. The reverse hyper is important because once you land here, to get the seeker to dash to the top coin instead of at you, you need to wait on the platform for a certain amount of time, and that amount of time just so happens to be the time it takes to perform a reverse hyper. Alternatively, if you aren't comfortable with reverse hypers yet, you can just wait for a little bit then do a hyper but a reverse hyper also helps with making the cornerboost afterwards more lenient.

### d-15 (Upper Area) 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/18.webp)

This simply involves an extended hyper into a buffered demo dash. I recommend holding your demo button down for the entire strat so you can do an extended demo hyper into a demo dash which cuts the inputs needed. It is also important to hold jump out of the demo hyper right up until you demodash, else you won’t get enough height. Takes some practice and getting used to but isn’t all too bad once you understand it and play around with it. You break even with going over the top with second try so I would only implement this into full game when you can get it first or second try every time without fail.

### d-04 (Lower Area)

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/19.webp)

Involving an ultra into a spikejump, this strat skips this screen almost entirely and allows you to get through it much quicker than the intended route. The only important part is when you ultra, the rest is fairly simple. 

![Image of strat](https://github.com/buhbai/arbguide/blob/master/Images/20.png)

This shows around about where you will want to be ultraing from out of the bubble - you want to ultra from the right half of this gold candle roughly. If you ultra later, you will dash into the spike floor. Once you ultra, do not hold down and you should be able to grab onto the side of the corner. From there, simply climbjump into the bubble.

Now that you’re in the bubble, all you have to do is move up with the bubble and quickly dash up out of it. This will make you grab the berry just barely whilst also breaking the bubble a lot sooner than if you were to continue with the bubble all the way to the ceiling, meaning the bubble will also respawn sooner. When you grab the berry, do not fast fall into the bubble, slow falling into it perfectly lands you inside it as it spawns. From there, you just head for the bubble near the exit.
